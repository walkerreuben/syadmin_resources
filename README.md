# Sysadmin (and other IT) Resources
I'm slowly collating a massive list of books, websites, and other resources valuable for system administrators and other IT roles. These have been gathered from countless online discussions, Google searches, and years of reading. Disclaimer: I haven't read all of these myself yet.

First off is the number one recommendation no matter where you ask: 
Time Management for System Administrators by Thomas A. Limoncelli

Reading this book will give you the time you need to get through the rest of this list.

I expect the format of this page to change as it grows, but for now:
